This is a program I wrote to help me organize incident reports at work!

In order to run the program, run this module in the python shell and follow the prompts. 

I've added a (fake) facility_file and incident_file in order for you to see how this works. I had to do this because 
the real names of MedTech facilities and incidents are private and confidential.

I've also included a write_here file, which is simply a blank text file for you to write to.

Thanks for checking out my program!
